WELCOME TO DISCO STU!

#This is a SPA -single page application- which shows a list of music albums.
#It has been created with Java using Eclipse as IDE. 
#The interface file connects with a MySQL database, and the DAO -data access object- file connects the files which do the CRUD -create, read, update, delete- operations. 
#The JSP files contain HTML and Java language to show the information stored in the DB. 
#The CSS is done by hand and responsive.

#Hope you like it :)
